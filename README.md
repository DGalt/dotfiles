# dotfiles

I am using GNU Stow to organize my dotfiles, following [this guide](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html?round=two).

Clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DGalt/dotfiles
```

And either run:
```bash
bash stow_all.sh
```

Or individuall stow each folder with
```bash
stow FOLDER_NAME
```
